This directory contains an empty map, which can be used to bootstrap a new game
act:

- Copy its content into a new subdir of data/storyline (data/storyline/act2, for
  instance) Be sure that the name is prefixed by "act".
- The ERASEME file in dialogs/ and titles/ can be removed.
- Add the declaration of the new game act in data/base/game_config.lua.

Then, start filling it !
